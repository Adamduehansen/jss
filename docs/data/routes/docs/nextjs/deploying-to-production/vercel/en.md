# Walkthrough: Deploying to Vercel


Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDNs supporting deployment and delivery of static & [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) apps. Vercel has first-class support for Next.js.

This guide will demonstrate deploying the Next.js sample app that's generated by the `jss create` command to Vercel. Assuming you already have the sample app set up and connected to a Sitecore instance, complete the following steps to deploy the sample app to production:

1. Execute the steps provided in the Next.js  guide for [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#getting-started) with deployment.
2. In the root directory of the application, in the `.env` file, add or modify:
	* `PUBLIC_URL` - your Vercel deployment URL.
	* `SITECORE_API_KEY` - your Sitecore API key is needed to build the app.
	* `SITECORE_API_HOST` - your Sitecore API hostname.
	* `JSS_EDITING_SECRET` - your secret token. The `JSS_EDITING_SECRET` is optional for deployments but necessary if you want to use the Experience Editor with your Next.js Vercel deployment. Read about [connecting your Next.js application to the Experience Editor](/docs/nextjs/experience-editor/walkthrough/en.md).
3. Push the changes to your Git provider.

## `publish:end` webhook invocation

Using the `publish:end` webhook, you can automatically trigger static site generation, cache clearing, and other automated activities with webhook support.

To enable the `Publish:end` hook, you must: 

1. [Create a deploy hook](https://vercel.com/docs/more/deploy-hooks#creating-a-deploy-hook) in Vercel.
1. On your Sitecore instance, edit `/App_Config/Sitecore/JavaScriptServices/Sitecore.JavaScriptServices.AppServices.PublishingWebHook.config.example`:
	* `url` - Required. The URL of the hook to be invoked.
	* `method` - Optional. The HTTP method for invoking webhook. Possible values are `POST` or `GET`. The default method is `POST`. 
	* `site` - Optional. The sites which should trigger the webhook when published. If you provide the site parameter, the webhook will be invoked if the published item root is an ancestor, descendant, or equal to the configured site's root item. 
1. Remove `.example` extension of `Sitecore.JavaScriptServices.AppServices.PublishingWebHook.config.example` file.
1. Publish items.
1. On Vercel, check that the end of the publishing process triggered a new deployment.
