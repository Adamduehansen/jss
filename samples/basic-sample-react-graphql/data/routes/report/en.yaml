          <p>Here's an example of how you can use JSS to create components that depend on child items of their datasource,
          such as defining a chart data series. To add a chart data point in experience editor, use the 'insert' button on the rendering.
          To edit existing chart series, click 'Edit the related item' under the datasource menu on the rendering.</p>
